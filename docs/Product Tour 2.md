Trusted Network
---------------

Take advantage of Qredoâ€™s secure and fast movement of digital assets through private transfer and swaps with your trusted network of counterparties.

You can add a trusted party by searching for their email address, name or alias to see if they are on the network. Any counterparties not on the network can be invited. An invited party will be asked to approve any connection requests first. When approved both parties will appear in each of the accounts list of trusted parties and will be available to transfer or swap assets with.

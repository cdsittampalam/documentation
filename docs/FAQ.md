### How do I create a duplicate withdrawal transaction?

Duplicating a withdrawal transaction is useful if you want to create another transaction to the same address. You can change the data within the transaction from the previous one, e.g., the withdrawal amounts.
Duplication saves you time as you only need to enter items that are different from the original transaction.

Note that, for a transaction to be duplicated, the original transaction must already be approved and in the Ledger view.

1. Click the Ledger icon.

![Ledger](/doc-images/ledger.png)

2. Identify the withdrawal transaction entry that you want to duplicate from the Ledger view.
3. At the end of the entry, click the three dots.
4. In the pop-up, choose **Duplicate**.
5. Enter details on the displayed form in the same way as for a new transaction.

### How do I monitor sign in requests?

You can see a history of sign in requests from your own account to Qredo in the Identity ledger. As well as for general monitoring, viewing requests can also be useful for security purposes. For example, you can track sign ins or sign in attempts that may have been made by another user masquerading as yourself.

The Identity ledger also shows password reset actions.

1. From the Qredo Wallet app, click the Approvals icon.

Use Funds for secure self-custody, fast transfers and capital management.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

A default fund is created for your account called Fund One, this is an example Fund for you to explore how funds are configured.

Funds
-----

A Fund is a way to organise assets secured on the Qredo Network. When creating a Fund you can choose the supported assets and add one or more custodians to govern their use. For Enterprise customers you will be able add multiple users to the fund and in addition configure roles and permissions.

Fund Settings
-------------

### Organising your holdings

Set the Fund name and description on the Fund Settings view. A Fund can be created to organise your holdings by a particular portfolio strategy, to segregate client assets, personalise it however you choose.

In the example Fund, the assets are limited to Bitcoin Testnet. Creating a new fund you can select the type of assets you would like to restrict it to.

Fund Members & Permissions
--------------------------

### Giving access to your funds

Multi-user friendly. With an Enterprise Plan you can add trusted parties to your funds.

Your default Fund, created for Individual accounts and lists the account owner as a member. Upgrading your plan to a Company Account will enable you to add additional multiple users to your account on Qredo. These users can then be given access to the fund where you can control their permissions.

Qredo Network rights management support a range of roles to enable admins to control and restrict certain fund actions such as initiating a trade or withdrawing funds.

Custodian Policy
----------------

**Governance under your control. Choose to self-custody or invite trusted parties as custodians.**

A key benefit of the Qredo Network is the ability to set policies by which movements of assets in Funds are controlled. By default, in Fund One the Account Owner is set as a Custodian in both the Withdrawal and TX Custodial Policies. Create a new Fund to set the number of custodians and approval threshold.

Assets
------

**Qredo Network’s cross-chain architecture allows a single view of all your assets.**

The Qredo Network makes it possible to focus on the underlying asset and not wallets. See full balances of your reserves by asset so you can make trades against your total asset holdings. Funds can be configured with one or more assets. For each asset configured for a Fund, it’s balance and transaction history are visible. Movement of the asset is controlled by the custodial policies set on the fund. In order to secure an asset on the Qredo Network a deposit address has to be created for the particular asset on the fund. By default the Deposit Address is automatically provided on creation of the Fund. To move an asset off the secure Qredo Network configure a list of safe Withdrawal Addresses that can be used.

Addresses
---------

**Securing your assets on the Network and providing controls around withdrawal.**

In order to secure assets using the Qredo Network you must transfer funds using a Qredo secured deposit address. The deposit address is simply a new entry block on the underlying asset blockchain where the digital signatures are secured by Qredo. Start by copying the deposit address for the fund and asset you wish to deposit to. The deposit address can be used on an external wallet explorer to transfer funds. Once transferred to the new entry block secured by Qredo, the funds will be governed according to the custodial policies configured for the fund. To withdraw assets from the Qredo secured block you just require a new address to withdraw to. This withdrawal ddress has to be first authorised for use in the Fund. Once whitelisted, the withdrawal address provides another control mechanism to limit where funds can be transferred.

TX History
----------

**Fully audited treasury view of by asset type**

Every asset in the Fund has a Transaction History. This statement is a record of all movements of the specificed asset in the fund including a running balance. From the Asset View you can withdraw, deposit and trade funds.

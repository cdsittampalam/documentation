Money can be added to Qredo network through a deposit transaction, and can leave the network through a withdraw transaction.

Deposit Money
-------------

For a deposit transaction, money is automatically added to a whitelisted external Bitcoin address which is linked to your fund. The default fund and asset that you have set up includes a deposit address, which is the Bitcoin wallet address that is linked to a Qredo fund. 

When money is added to a whitelisted address for a fund on Qredo, it is safely stored on the Qredo blockchain as a transaction. Once on the blockchain, it is subject to the custodial policies for the fund. The money in the fund is also liquid and ready to be transfered to another Qredo user if required.

2. Go to Asset view.
3. In the TX ledger, click the **Deposit** tab.
4. The TX ledger shows these details:

|     |     |

If the custodians have signed the transaction, the status is set to COMPLETE. However, if the custodians have signed the transaction and it has not successfully been completed, the status is set to THRESHOLD NOT MET or REJECTED. |

Withdraw Money
--------------

To withdraw, you send money out of a fund on Qredo to a whitelisted external Bitcoin address. When sent to a whitelisted address, the money becomes available on the underlying blockchain, and is no longer subject to the custody policies and ownership rights of the Qredo network. Qredo gives you the flexibility of adding money back on to the network at a later point in time. Any crypto and capital markets participant, such as an institution, investor, or trader, can withdraw money as part of their investment activities.

You set up a withdrawal transaction as a trade initiator using the web app. To confirm that you want the transaction to happen, you can authorise it through the mobile app.

### Qredo Fees

Qredo charges fees to withdraw, including the Qredo fee and the miner's fee, The Qredo fee allows the management of Qredo wallets. While the miner's fee covers the work and resources they need to generate blocks on the underlying network. You are presented with details of these fees when you confirm the transaction.While the miner and Qredo fee is fixed for any withdrawal transaction, Qredo can periodically alter these fees.

### Custodian Role

As a custodian, you can decide if a withdrawal started by a trade initiator should happen by approving or rejecting the transaction. If all custodians under the threshold of the withdrawal custody policy have approved, the transaction takes place and is recorded on the Qredo blockchain. You will only be able to sign the transaction if you are a custodian for the withdrawal policy linked to the fund of the transaction. For more details on thresholds and custody policies, refer to [Fund Administration](/docs/Fund%20Administration). 

### Create a New Address

If you do not have a withdrawal address, you need to create one before the transaction.

As a custodian, you can approve the withdrawal address for the transaction if it is whitelisted. However, if the address is deemed insecure, you can reject the new address (see [Approve an Address (Custodian)](#approve-an-address-custodian))

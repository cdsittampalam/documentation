id: Deposit & Withdraw

---

For a deposit transaction, users can add money to a whitelisted cryptocurrency address that is linked to your fund (either the default fund or one you created). Once added, the money is safely stored on the Qredo blockchain as a transaction and is subject to the custodial policies of its associated fund. Details on deposit addresses appear in both Asset and Ledger view. The Qredo Network ensures that deposited money remains liquid, and is ready to be transferred to another Qredo user if needed.

For a withdrawal transaction, you send money out of a fund on Qredo to an external cryptocurrency address. When sent to a whitelisted address, the money is no longer subject to the custody policies and ownership rights of the Qredo Network. Qredo gives you the flexibility of adding money back on to the network at a later point in time.

:::info
When recorded on the Qredo blockchain, a transaction is always linked to the underlying blockchain.

Summary of Steps
----------------

For deposits, you can:  
  - [view deposit addresses](#view-deposit-addresses)
  - [copy an address](#copy-address)
  - [view transactions](#view-transactions)

For withdrawals, a trade initiator can:
  - [create a new address](#create-new-address)
  - [create a transaction](#create-transaction)
  - [track progress](#track-progress) in different ways

A custodian that is nominated can [approve a withdrawal](#approve-withdrawal) 

View Deposit Addresses
----------------------

The default fund and asset that you have set up includes a deposit address, which is the cryptocurrency wallet address that is linked to a Qredo fund. However, any
fund that you create is linked to a deposit address. The address is securely created using the MPC protocol. 

You are notified when money arrives at your address via an email.

1. Click the asset or ledger icon.

Copy Address
------------

To ensure that a deposit address is valid, you can copy the address using the Copy Address function before adding it to a third-party application. When copied, the address is stored in your system's clipboard. For example, you can copy an address before adding to Blockchain explorer.

Click the **Copy** button on the address entry.

View Transactions
-----------------

In Ledger view, you can see deposit transactions to one or more funds that you are the owner of. All deposit transactions are listed in the Inbound tab.

Create New Address

Create Transaction

For withdrawing money, the Qredo app consists of a wizard that lets you withdraw a specific amount of an asset from a fund. There needs to be a destination cryptocurrency address in which to add the money to. You must ensure that you enter the correct asset, amount, address, and fund for the withdrawal. You also set the date and time or number of days for custodian approval, according to the length of your approval process.
You review and approve the transaction before a custodian is notified.

While the miner's Blockchain fee is fixed for any withdrawal transaction, Qredo can periodically alter these fees.
:::

1. To start the withdrawal, click **Initiate Withdrawal**. You are then prompted to check your phone app.  
2. To return to the previous screen, click **Back**.

### Authorise Withdrawal

Before authorising, you can view its details including the fees that are charged on the transaction.

1.  Tap the notification that you received on your phone. The Withdraw screen shows with details of the transaction including fees.

![Authwith](/doc-images/authwithd.png)

2.  To authorise, tap **Authorise**.   
3.  To reject, tap **Reject**.

A withdrawal transaction can only be sent out of Qredo if it has met or has exceeded the threshold level for the number of custodian signatures. The threshold level is entered on the fund associated with the transaction.

### Approve Withdrawal

As a custodian, you can decide if a withdrawal started by a trade initiator should happen by approving or rejecting the transaction. If all custodians under the threshold of the withdrawal custody policy have approved, the transaction takes place and is recorded on the Qredo blockchain. You will only be able to sign the transaction if you are a custodian for the withdrawal policy linked to the fund of the transaction. For more details on thresholds and custody policies, refer to the [Behaviours] section in the Qredo Network page(/docs/Qredo%20Network/#behaviours).

You receive a notification as soon as the trade initiator has authorised the withdrawal. The Withdrawal screen on your phone asks you to approve or reject the new transaction. The screen also shows the following information:

*   type of asset and amount.
*   the name linked to the recipient address.    
*   the name of the trade initiator.

2.  Click **Show Details** to view more details of the transaction.
3.  To approve, tap **Approve**.    
4.  To reject, tap **Reject**.

For the action you select, you sign in with your biometric features and 6-digit passcode, and tap confirm in the confirmation screens.

Track Progress
--------------

As the trade initiator, you can check the approval progress for address creation and transactions. Both addresses and transactions require approval from custodians.

A withdrawal transaction can only happen if it has met or has exceeded the threshold level for the number of custodian signatures. The threshold level is entered on the fund associated with the transaction.

You can view approvals from the Approval view, which appears by clicking the Approvals icon:

![tick](/doc-images/tick.png)

These include details of:

* [address approvals](#address-approvals) from the trade initiator of a specific fund.
* [transactions approvals](#transaction-approvals) that cover those from the trade initiator and one or more custodians.
* [custodian approvals](#custodian-approvals) specifically for the fund of the transaction.
* [Transactions in Ledger View](#transaction-view-ledger) for all funds under your account.
* [progress details](#progress-details) in the form of a summary screen in both Approval and Ledger view.

id: Invite Trusted Parties
---
As the account owner, you can invite users as trusted parties, allowing you to build your Qredo Network. A trusted party can send and receive money, and/or approve and reject as a nominated custodian.

You can invite a user to be a trusted party from within the Qredo Network, or from outside of Qredo. Users from within the Qredo Network can be an account owner, or a counterparty to another account owner. When choosing a party externally, you can invite them via LinkedIn, Telegram or WhatsApp.  

When you send an invite through the Qredo Network, users can approve or reject the invitation on their phone.

You invite a counterparty from the Trusted Network screen on the browser desktop app. The Trusted Network screen also lets you manage accepted invitations, and those that are still pending.

Manage Invite List
------------------

The Trusted Network screen shows the status of your invites sent to either contacts outside of Qredo or to users within the Qredo Network. Invite entries show as either:  

*  PAIRED - where the user or contact has accepted the invite.  
*  PENDING - where the user or contact has not yet accepted the invite.

![Trustednetworkupdate](/doc-images/3trustednetworkscreenupdate.png)

If you have just sent an invite and are waiting for the recipient to accept, the invite shows PENDING.

If you have sent an invite to contacts via LinkedIn, Telegram or WhatsApp, the status of PENDING can mean that it has been rejected. If the user has not accepted the invite, they can still invite you to join their network at a later time as their trusted party.

### Clear Paired Status

If there are many invites in the list, you can manage the list to show fewer invites by clearing the paired entries. Double-click the button for each entry labelled **Paired**.

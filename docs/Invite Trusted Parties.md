id: Invite Trusted Parties
---
As the account owner, you can invite users as trusted parties, allowing you to build your Qredo network. A trusted party can send and receive money, and/or approve and reject as a nominated custodian.

You can invite a user to be a trusted party from within the Qredo network, or from outside of Qredo. Users from within the Qredo network can be an account owner, or a counterparty to another account owner. When choosing a party externally, you can invite them via LinkedIn, Telegram or WhatsApp.  

When you send an invite through the Qredo network, users can approve or reject the invitation on their phone (See [Custodian Approvals](#custodian-approvals)).

You invite a counterparty from the Trusted Network screen on the browser desktop app. The Trusted Network screen also lets you manage accepted invitations, and those that are still pending (see [Manage Invite List](#manage-invite-list)).

### Add from Qredo

You enter an email address for a user on the Qredo network. The email address must match that held in the database for an existing user to be added. If the email address does not match, you will need to find out their correct email address and enter it again.

1.  Enter the email address of the user and click **Search**.
2.  If the user is on the Qredo network with that email address, a box appears asking you to confirm pairing with the email address.

3.  Click **Confirm**. Check the Trusted Network screen for details of the new invite see ([Manage the Invite List](#manage-invite-list)).

### Add from Contacts

In the Invite to Join Qredo section, click **Copy** and then the button of the service for the invites (LinkedIn, Telegram, or WhatsApp). The invite is sent directly to a recipient via the selected service. The users see the invite as a link to the sign up page on the Qredo website.

You can check the Trusted Network screen for details of the new invite (see the next section).

Manage Invite List
------------------

The Trusted Network screen shows the status of your invites sent to either contacts outside of Qredo or to users within the Qredo network. Invite entries show as either:  

*  PAIRED - where the user or contact has accepted the invite.  
*  PENDING - where the user or contact has not yet accepted the invite.

![Trustednetworkupdate](/doc-images/3trustednetworkscreenupdate.png)

If you have just sent an invite and are waiting for the recipient to accept, the invite shows PENDING.

If you have sent an invite to contacts via LinkedIn, Telegram or WhatsApp, the status of PENDING can mean that it has been rejected. If the user has not accepted the invite, they can still invite you to join their network at a later time as their trusted party.

### Clear Paired Status

If there are many invites in the list, you can manage the list to show fewer invites by clearing the paired entries. Double-click the button for each entry labelled **Paired**.

Custodian Approvals
-------------------

As a user on the Qredo network, you would have received an invite on your phone to become part of another user's network. Accepting an invite pairs your contact details with the Qredo user that invited you. Pairing lets you access the contact details of the user that has invited you, and vice-versa.

If you do not want to be part of their network, you can reject their invite.

### Approve Request  

1.  Tap on the notification for the invitation.
2.  Sign in to the app using the biometric feature of your phone.
3.  Enter your 6-digit PIN. The Trusted Party screen shows.

6.  Then tap **Confirm** in the Confirmation screen.  A screen appears to show that approval has been granted.
7.  Tap **Close**.

You will then see the following screen indicating that the request has been actioned with the status of APPROVED.

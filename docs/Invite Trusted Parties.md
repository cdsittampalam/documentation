Invite from Qredo

1. From any of the Qredo Wallet App screens, click the **Trusted Network** icon:

Accept an Invite
----------------

As a user on the Qredo Network, you would have received an invite on your Qredo Signing App to become part of another user's network. Accepting an invite pairs your contact details with the Qredo user that invited you. Pairing lets you access the contact details of the user that has invited you, and vice-versa.

1. Tap on the notification for the invite.
2. Sign in to the app using the biometric feature of your phone.
3. Enter your 6-digit PIN. The Trusted Party screen shows.

6. Then tap **Confirm** in the Confirmation screen.  A screen appears to show that approval has been granted.
7. Tap **Close**.

You will then see the following screen indicating that the request has been actioned with the status of APPROVED.

1. To reject the pairing request, tap **Reject** in the Trusted Party screen.
2. Authenticate using the biometric feature and 6-digit PIN.
3. Tap **Confirm** in the Confirmation screen. A screen appears which shows that approval has been granted.

-----------------

In the Approvals view, you can monitor responses to your invites. The Approvals view shows trusted parties that have approved and/or rejected invites.

   ![Button Approve](/doc-images/button-approve.png)  

2. In the Approvals view, click the **Trusted Parties** tab.

The view shows entries for invites that have been approved or denied. The invites entries are grouped in to **Pending** and **Actioned**.

![action approve](/doc-images/actionedapprove3.png)

The Approvals view also shows these details of the trusted party:

- Location of the trusted party.
- Email address of the trusted party.
- Network status of the trusted party.
- Date in which the invite was actioned.

The status shows the following information:

- For invite entries that are pending, the status shows as AWAITING CONFIRMATION.
- For invite entries that have been actioned, the status shows as AUTHORISED or IGNORED.

Manage Invite List
------------------

The Trusted Network screen shows the status of your invites sent to either contacts outside of Qredo or to users within the Qredo Network. Invite entries show as either:  

*  PAIRED - where the user or contact has accepted the invite.  
*  PENDING - where the user or contact has not yet accepted the invite.

![Trustednetworkupdate](/doc-images/3trustednetworkscreenupdate.png)

If you have just sent an invite and are waiting for the recipient to accept, the invite shows PENDING.

If you have sent an invite to contacts via LinkedIn, Telegram or WhatsApp, the status of PENDING can mean that it has been rejected. If the user has not accepted the invite, they can still invite you to join their network at a later time as their trusted party.

### Clear Paired Status

If there are many invites in the list, you can manage the list to show fewer invites by clearing the paired entries. Double-click the button for each entry labelled **Paired**.

id: Invite Trusted Parties
---
As the account owner, you can invite users as trusted parties, allowing you to build your Qredo network. A trusted party manages custodial policies where they can approve and reject trades. The trusted party can also send and receive money within the Qredo network.

You can invite a user to be a trusted party from within the Qredo network, or from outside of Qredo. Users from within the Qredo network can be an account owner, or a counterparty to another account owner. When choosing a party externally, you can invite them via LinkedIn, Telegram or WhatsApp.  

When you send an invite through the Qredo network, users can approve or reject the invitation on their phone (See [Approve or Deny Counterparty Invites](https://github.com/kdslang/documentation/blob/develop/docs/Approve-and-Deny-Counterparty-Invites.md).

You invite a counterparty from the Trusted Network screen on the browser desktop app. The Trusted Network screen also lets you manage accepted invitations, and those that are still pending (see [Manage the Invite List](https://github.com/kdslang/documentation/blob/develop/docs/Manage-the-Invite-List.md)).

Go to either Add a User from the Qredo Network or Add a User from your Contacts.

### Add from Qredo

You enter an email address for a user on the Qredo network. The email address must match that held in the database for an existing user to be added. If the email address does not match, you will need to find out their correct email address and enter it again. Alternatively, you can add them via LinkedIn, Telegram, or WhatsApp in the same way as adding a counterparty from outside of Qredo.

1.  Enter the email address of the user and click Search.
2.  If the user is on the Qredo network with that email address, a box appears asking you to confirm pairing with the email address.

3.  Click **Confirm**. Check the Trusted Network screen for details of the new invite (see Manage the Invite List).

### Add from Contacts

In the Invite to Join Qredo section, click **Copy** and then the button of the platform for sending the invites (LinkedIn, Telegram, or WhatsApp).  
The invite is sent directly via the selected platform. The users see the invite as a link to the sign up page on the Qredo website.

You can check the Trusted Network screen for details of the new invite.

Manage Invite List
------------------

The Trusted Network screen shows the status of your invites for joining the Qredo network as trusted counterparties. Invite entries show as either:  
⦁ paired - where the user or contact has accepted the invite.  
⦁ pending - where the user or contact has not yet accepted the invite.

![](https://qredo.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/70975942/3-trusted%20network%20screen%20update.png?api=v2)

The displayed invites would have been sent to your contacts outside of Qredo, or to users within the Qredo network. If you have just sent an invite and are waiting for the recipient to accept, the invite shows as pending.

An invite that is pending can mean that it has been rejected. If the user has not accepted the invite, they can still invite you to join their network at a later time (as a trusted counterparty).

### Clear Paired Status

To help you manage your invite list, you can clear invite entries that have been paired by double-clicking the buttons labelled **Paired**.

Custodian Approvals
-------------------

As a user on the Qredo network, you would have received an invite on your phone to become part of another user's network. When invited, you become a trusted counterparty where you can become a custodian of their fund policies, as well as send and receive money. Accepting an invite pairs your contact details with the Qredo user that invited you. Pairing lets you access the contact details of the user that has invited you, and vice-versa.

If you do not want to be part of their network, you can deny their invite.

Once you have signed in to the mobile app, the screen appears similar to the following:

id: Fund Administration

---

As the Account Owner, you have complete control over funds. You can view information on funds and transactions, and create funds to use on the Qredo network. A fund in Qredo is a financial vehicle in your account that contains all the assets for use in transfer, deposit, and withdrawal transactions. A fund is also associated with custody policies.

Any user that wants to use Qredo to make investments via transactions on the Qredo network can use funds or create funds themselves. The following are examples:

*   **Institutions** These users, e.g. large banks, can create funds for investment where custodians can accept or reject transactions made by the investing institution.
    
*   **Custody Provider** A custody provider may also be able to own a fund and seek other financial stakeholders to approve or reject transactions.
    
*   **Traders** Traders can create transactions once they have created the funds.

Holdings Page

The Holdings page consists of:the summary section that allows you to create a fund or view attributes of a default fund.

The system creates a deposit address for you to receive assets (see [View Fund One](#view-fund-one)).
    
*   **Change Default Settings:** Fund One contains Bitcoin Testnet, which allows you to familiarise yourself with Qredo and how transactions work. However, you can also include Fund Two as another default fund, where Fund One contains Bitcoin and Fund Two contains Bitcoin Testnet (see [Change Default Settings](#change-default-settings)).

### Membership & Permissions

The Membership & Permissions section shows your name as a fund member with the permission of owner. Fund One is assigned to you as a fund member with the permission of Owner once you have come onboard. The permission of Owner means that you have control over the assets and the custodian policies of the fund. As the fund member, you can set custody policies to withdraw and transfer funds, and perform the operations of withdrawal and transfers. The fund includes a deposit address that contains funds.

When you create other funds, you will also be the sole fund member.

### Custody

The Custody section shows the custody policies of a fund. A custody policy determines the custodians that can sign a transaction, and whose signatures are needed for transfers and/or withdrawals. Each custodian has a permission of transfer and/or withdrawal. However, in Fund One the custodian is the fund owner.

As a custody provider accepting or rejecting transactions on behalf of an investing fund owner, the custody policy settings within a fund are particularly important. For example, depending on the type of investment, transactions within some funds may require more signatures than others.

---

#### Threshold

A policy also includes a threshold that has the minimum number of custodian signatures out of the total number for a transaction to happen.

#### Withdrawal and TX Tabs

The Withdrawal and TX tabs include custody policies comprising of custodians and the associated threshold levels for withdrawals and transfers. Withdrawals and transfers can have different custodians and threshold levels. For Fund One, there is only one custodian and a threshold policy of 1/1 for both withdrawals and transfers.

:::info
When you create a fund, you can assign any number of custodians for withdrawals and transfers.

Create a Fund Wizard
--------------------

The Create a Fund wizard lets you quickly create a fund and add custody policies for withdrawals and transfers. You can set the same or different custodians for withdrawal and transfer policies. These policies can also include different Threshold levels.

When you select custodians, you can also choose the Threshold level. A Threshold includes the minimum number of custodian signatures out of the total number for a transaction to happen. A higher threshold level needing more signatures means that custodians have more power to restrict the transaction from taking place. A lower threshold means they have less power to restrict the transaction since fewer signatures are needed.

### Example

In the example of Fund A, Bob, Dave, and Alice are custodians in a fund. However, not all of them are custodians for individual withdrawal and transfer policies. Each policy contains a set Threshold level.

![Fund A](/doc-images/ManagingFundA.png)

You can repeat the steps to create multiple funds differentiated by the asset type and/or group of custodians.

---

### Custody Providers

As an investor creating funds, you will need to work closely with a custody provider in order to decide policies and threshold levels. This can depend on the type of fund and the level of risk that exist. For example, for a more risky investment you may want a higher number of aggregated signatures.

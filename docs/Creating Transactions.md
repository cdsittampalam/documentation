Overview
---------

Transactions allow a trade initiator to transfer money to a recipient (or counterparty) within the same fund. All money during a transfer
stays on the Qredo network, and is secure on the Qredo blockchain. With assets of the Qredo network, instead of in cold storage, crypto and capital market participants
can easily keep their money liquid by transferring amounts between participants.

Future versions will allow atomic swaps that provide instant exchange of different digital assets.

### Qredo Fees

Qredo charges fees of 1 basis point, or 0.01%, of the amount transferred.

As a fund owner and member, you have the permission to transfer money from one Qredo user to another. This permission is shown in the **Permissions** tab on the Settings section of your account.

### Custodian Role

As a custodian, you can decide if a withdrawal started by a trade initiator should happen by approving or rejecting the transaction. If all custodians under the threshold of the transfer custody policy have approved, the transaction takes place and is recorded on the Qredo blockchain. You will only be able to sign the transaction if you are a custodian for the transfer policy linked to the fund of the transaction. For more details on thresholds and custody policies, refer to [Fund Administration](/docs/Fund#20Administration#custody).
For approving a transfer (see Approve a Transfer).

Create Transfer
---------------

For transferring money, the Qredo app consists of a wizard that lets you transfer a specific amount to a Qredo user. You must ensure that you enter the correct asset, amount, counterparty, and fund for the transfer.

You also set the date and time or number of days for custodian approval, according to the length of your approval process.

You launch the withdrawal process from either the Transaction Ledger or the Asset level.

2. Click **Continue**. The Transfer screen shows.

6.  Enter the sum of money that you want to withdraw in **Amount**.
7.  Type in a reference number in **Reference**.
8.  To select a date for when the transfer takes place, click **Expires In** and enter days, hours, and minutes in the displayed fields.

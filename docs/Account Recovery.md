id: Account Recovery

We can get you back up and running if you are locked out of your account or have lost your mobile phone.

Forgotten your password?
------------------------

Simple request a new password from the login page, you’ll need the Qredo Signing app to authorise any changes to your account.

Lost or stolen Phone?
---------------------

Don’t panic. Once you have a replacement phone you can use your seed recovery phase to install your master seed on your new phone.

Transferring to a New Phone
---------------------------

If you have a new phone or the previous phone was lost/stolen, you can use your seed recovery phrase to recreate your master seed on the new device. Once your master seed has been recovered you can regain access to your account and continue to sign authorisations and approvals.

If you ever suspect your account has been compromised please contact support.

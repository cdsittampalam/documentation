Qredo Wallet App
-------------

The Qredo Wallet app provides a suite of account management, treasury and trading features making it easy to manage your digital asset portfolios online within the Qredo Network. Set up secure funds to
* secure your client and trading accounts.
* customise your governance rules.
* monitor inbound and outbound trade activity.
* review pending and actioned payment authorisations with instant access to your trusted counterparty network.

As an app user, e.g. a trader or a fund manager, you can launch your transactions through the web interface. Once approved by custodians as stated in the custody policy, your transaction is securely stored on the Qredo blockchain.

Qredo Signing App
----------------

The Qredo Signing app acts as a secure multi-factor signing device using a combination of biometrics, a 6 digit pin, and a master seed (or secret key). The Qredo Signing app allows you to securely authorise transfer and changes to your account which you initiated from the desktop browser app.

As an appointed custodian, you use the Qredo Signing app to approve transactions which provide the digital signatures for transactions to be secured on the Qredo blockchain.  The Qredo Signing app allows you to be instantly notified as soon as the trade initiator has authorised a transaction.

The authorisation and approval flow also allows signs in from:
* logging in activities via the web browser.
* other users requesting to join the Qredo Network.
* whitelisting cryptocurrency addresses.

The Qredo Wallet app runs on Safari, Chrome, Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Opera.

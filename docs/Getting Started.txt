### Pairing Steps
Once you have downloaded the phone app, you are ready to pair your phone with the web app. You will see a landing page for the mobile app on your phone.

You scan a QR-code on the web app through your phone’s camera, which pairs the phone with the mobile app. The pairing process ensures that only your phone can be used together with the web app. The unique QR-code that shows on the web app can only be used once.

2.  Tap **OK**. Then confirm your action in a message triggered from your device’s operating system. The QR-code shows on the phone screen.

### Master Seed Steps

Once you have completed pairing, you are ready to create your master seed. The master seed is a security feature that bonds your Qredo identify with your phone. It is stored on your device’s secure enclave. To ensure that the master seed is backed up, it is registered on the Qredo network.

If in the unlikely event that data is lost, you will need to recover your master seed through your seed recovery phrase. The seed recovery phrase, consisting of a unique 24-word combination, is different to a common password, which you may be more likely to forget or lose.

In addition, you will also set up a 6-digit PIN. The PIN is used with the biometric feature of your phone that is either the Face ID or Touch ID.

Before you create a master seed, the phone lets you scroll through an interactive guide. Tap **Get Started** and the buttons in the subsequent screens.

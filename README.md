Qredo Documentation

Documentation system is built using Docusauras V2(https://v2.docusaurus.io/) which is built on React. 


The build is trigerred when the 'master' branch is updated. GitHub actions are initiated when master branch is updated and the deployment settings are in the .github/workflows section of the project. 

The branch gh-pages is auto generated by Docusauras to deploy whenever master branch is updated. The branch should not be manually edited.

There is another branch called 'develop' which will track master branch and changes must be done to the 'develop' branch and in turn those chages should be merged to the Master branch.

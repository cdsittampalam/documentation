# Qredo Network Documentation Website

Documentation system is built using Docusauras V2(https://v2.docusaurus.io/), which is built on React. 

The build is trigerred when the 'master' branch is updated. 

There is another branch called 'develop' which is used to generate the QA/Staging site. 

Updates/PRs must be done to the 'develop' branch and in turn those chages will eventually be merged to the Master branch. 

Once the content is approved in the develop branch we will merge those changes into the Master branch, and the public facing website(s) will be updated.

For more information on how to add and edit content, please see the [Qredo Network Documentation Wiki](https://github.com/qredo/documentation/wiki).

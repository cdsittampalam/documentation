Qredo Documentation

Documentation system is built using Docusauras V2(https://v2.docusaurus.io/) which is built on React. 

The build is trigerred when the 'master' branch is updated. 

There is another branch called 'develop' which will track master branch and changes must be done to the 'develop' branch and in turn those chages should be merged to the Master branch. 

We use the 'develop' branch as a staging / QA branch. Once the content is approved in the develop branch we will merge those changes into the Master branch, and the public facing website(s) will be updated.

For more information on how to add and edit content, please see the [Repo's Wiki](https://github.com/qredo/documentation/wiki)
